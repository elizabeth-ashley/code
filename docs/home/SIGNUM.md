The processes that control erosion cause geomorphological events that describe earth’s surface. This includes aspects of geology that explain the development of landforms and how those landforms are pieced together to form vast landscapes. By modeling the erosion process a better prediction of future geologic reconstruction can be developed to provide a clear understanding of Earth’s geomorphology. Main formulations of erosion in this study include stream channeling through bedrock, uplift and linear diffusion.

If I change the parameters for uplift, stream power, and linear diffusion, then I will be able to better understand how to model the morphological processes of mountain building. SIGNUM or Simple Integrated Geomorphological Numerical Model simulates sediment transport and erosion by river flow, hill slope diffusion, fluvial incision and tectonic uplift. This study will use the stream power equation, linear diffusion and uplift rates to analyze the effects it has in the SIGNUM model.

## Uplift
This function calculates height variations where uf is a parameter that will be varied under default parameters.
