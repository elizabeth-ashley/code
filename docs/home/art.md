## Hand Drawn Maps
 I have been hand drawing maps since I was 14 years old. In the old days I used pencil and paper nowadays I use Procreate.

## Great Springs Project
A T-shirt design for the [Great Springs Project](https://greatspringsproject.org). This project focused on 4 highly populated cities. Each city has a major spring located in it, and the mission of the project is to ‘connect and protect’ the springs. Basically, connect with a trail and protect with land conservation. I took a map from ArcGIS of the 4 cities located within the extent of the Edwards Aquifer and vectorized the map layout then imported it into Illustrator.

## Interactive Charging Station
Poster I created for a charging station in Denali National Park & Preserve, Alaska. This allows visitors to easily scan a QR code (which links to current park research) and learn while waiting for their phone to charge.
