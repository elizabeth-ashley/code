## Great Springs Project
A T-shirt design the Great Springs Project. I took a map from ArcGIS of highly populated cities located within the extent of the Edwards Aquifer and vectorized the map layout then imported it into Illustrator.

## Interactive Charging Station
Poster I created for a charging station in Denali National Park & Preserve, Alaska. This allows visitors to easily scan a QR code (which links to current park research) and learn while waiting for their phone to charge.
